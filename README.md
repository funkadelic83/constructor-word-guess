This is a CLI node app word constructor game that is under construction. Upon completion, it will prompt the user for a letter to guess, then display the correctly guessed letters until the game is over. The user gets 7 incorrect guesses before losing.

This game was developed by Mike Damanskis as part of the UCLA Web Development coding bootcamp. I can be reached at MikeDamanskis@gmail.com
